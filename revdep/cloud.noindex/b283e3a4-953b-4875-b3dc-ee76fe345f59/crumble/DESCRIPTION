Description: Implements a modern, unified estimation strategy for common 
	mediation estimands (natural effects, organic effects, interventional effects, 
	and recanting twins) in combination with modified treatment policies as 
	described in Liu, Williams, Rudolph, and Díaz (2024) 
	<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2408.14620>. Estimation makes use of recent advancements 
	in Riesz-learning to estimate a set of required nuisance parameters with 
	deep learning. The result is the capability to estimate mediation effects with 
	binary, categorical, continuous, or multivariate exposures with 
	high-dimensional mediators and mediator-outcome confounders using machine 
	learning.
