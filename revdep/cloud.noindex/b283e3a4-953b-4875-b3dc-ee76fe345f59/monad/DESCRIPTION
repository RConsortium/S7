Package: monad
Title: Operators and Generics for Monads
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: 
    person("Mikko", "Marttila", , "mikkmart@protonmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Compose generic monadic function pipelines with %>>% and %>-%
    based on implementing the 'S7' generics fmap() and bind(). Methods are
    provided for the built-in list type and the maybe class from the
    'maybe' package. The concepts are modelled directly after the Monad
    typeclass in Haskell, but adapted for idiomatic use in R.
