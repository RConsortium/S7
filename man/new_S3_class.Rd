\title{Declare an S3 class}
\usage{
new_S3_class(class, constructor = NULL, validator = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{class}{S3 class vector (i.e. what \code{class()} returns). For method
registration, you can abbreviate this to a single string, the S3 class
name.}

\item{constructor}{An optional constructor that can be used to create
objects of the specified class. This is only needed if you wish to
have an S7 class inherit from an S3 class or to use the S3 class as a
property without a default. It must be specified in the
same way as a S7 constructor: the first argument should be \code{.data}
(the base type whose attributes will be modified).

All arguments to the constructor should have default values so that
when the constructor is called with no arguments, it returns returns
an "empty", but valid, object.}

\item{validator}{An optional validator used by \code{\link[=validate]{validate()}} to check that
the S7 object adheres to the constraints of the S3 class.

A validator is a single argument function that takes the object to
validate and returns \code{NULL} if the object is valid. If the object is
invalid, it returns a character vector of problems.}
}
\value{
An S7 definition of an S3 class, i.e. a list with class
\code{S7_S3_class}.
}
\description{
To use an S3 class with S7, you must explicitly declare it using
\code{new_S3_class()} because S3 lacks a formal class definition.
(Unless it's an important base class already defined in \link{base_s3_classes}.)
}
\section{Method dispatch, properties, and unions}{
There are three ways of using S3 with S7 that only require the S3 class
vector:
\itemize{
\item Registering a S3 method for an S7 generic.
\item Restricting an S7 property to an S3 class.
\item Using an S3 class in an S7 union.
}

This is easy, and you can usually include the \code{new_S3_class()}
call inline:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode R">}}\preformatted{method(my_generic, new_S3_class("factor")) <- function(x) "A factor"
new_class("my_class", properties = list(types = new_S3_class("factor")))
new_union("character", new_S3_class("factor"))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\section{Extending an S3 class}{
Creating an S7 class that extends an S3 class requires more work. You'll
also need to provide a constructor for the S3 class that follows S7
conventions. This means the first argument to the constructor should be
\code{.data}, and it should be followed by one argument for each attribute used
by the class.

This can be awkward because base S3 classes are usually heavily wrapped for user
convenience and no low level constructor is available. For example, the
factor class is an integer vector with a character vector of \code{levels}, but
there's no base R function that takes an integer vector of values and
character vector of levels, verifies that they are consistent, then
creates a factor object.

You may optionally want to also provide a \code{validator} function which will
ensure that \code{\link[=validate]{validate()}} confirms the validity of any S7 classes that build
on this class. Unlike an S7 validator, you are responsible for validating
the types of the attributes.

The following code shows how you might wrap the base Date class.
A Date is a numeric vector with class \code{Date} that can be constructed with
\code{.Date()}.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode R">}}\preformatted{S3_Date <- new_S3_class("Date",
  function(.data = integer()) \{
    .Date(.data)
  \},
  function(self) \{
    if (!is.numeric(self)) \{
      "Underlying data must be numeric"
    \}
  \}
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\examples{
# No checking, just used for dispatch
Date <- new_S3_class("Date")

my_generic <- new_generic("my_generic", "x")
method(my_generic, Date) <- function(x) "This is a date"

my_generic(Sys.Date())
}
