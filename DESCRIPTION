Description: A new object oriented programming system designed to be a
    successor to S3 and S4. It includes formal class, generic, and method
    specification, and a limited form of multiple dispatch. It has been
    designed and implemented collaboratively by the R Consortium
    Object-Oriented Programming Working Group, which includes
    representatives from R-Core, 'Bioconductor', 'Posit'/'tidyverse', and
    the wider R community.
