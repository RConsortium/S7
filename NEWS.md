# S7 (development version)

* Fixed an issue where a custom property `getter()` would infinitely recurse 
  when accessing itself (reported in #403, fixed in #406).

* Property setting (via `prop<-` and `@<-`) rewritten in C for performance (#396).

* Fixed a regression where `validate()` would not be called after a custom
  property setter was invoked (reported in #393, fixed in #396).

* When a method is not found, the error now has class `S7_error_method_not_found`.

* The `Ops` generic now falls back to base Ops behaviour when one of the
  arguments is not an S7 object (#320). This means that you get the somewhat
  inconsistent base behaviour, but means that S7 doesn't introduce a new axis
  of inconsistency.

* In `new_class()`, properties can either be named by naming the element
  of the list or by supplying the `name` argument to `new_property()` (#371).

* `super()` now works with Ops methods (#357).

* `method()` now generates an informative message when dispatch fails (#387).

* S7 provides a new automatic backward compatibility mechanism to provide
  a version of `@` that works in R before version 4.3 (#326).

* Can create multimethods that dispatch on `NULL`.

* `prop()` optimized and rewritten in C (#395).

# S7 0.1.1

* Classes get a more informative print method (#346).

* Correctly register S3 methods for S7 objects with a package (#333).

* External methods are now registered using an attribute of the S3 methods
  table rather than an element of that environment. This prevents a warning
  being generated during the "code/documentation mismatches" check in
  `R CMD check` (#342).

* `class_missing` and `class_any` can now be unioned with `|` (#337).

* `new_object()` no longer accepts `NULL` as `.parent`.

* `new_object()` now correctly runs the validator from abstract parent classes
  (#329).

* `new_object()` works better when custom property setters modify other
  properties.

* `new_property()` gains a `validator` argument that allows you to specify
  a per-property validator (#275).

* `new_property()` clarifies that it's the user's responsibility to return
  the correct class; it is _not_ automatically validated.

* Properties with a custom setter are now validated _after_ the setter has
  run and are validated when the object is constructed or when you call
  `validate()`, not just when you modify them after construction.

* `S7_inherits()` now accepts `class = NULL` to test if an object is any
  sort of S7 object (#347).

# S7 0.1.0

## May-July 2023

* `new_external_generic()` is only needed when you want a soft dependency
  on another package.

* `methods_register()` now also registers S3 and S4 methods (#306).

## Jan-May 2023

* Subclasses of abstract class can have readonly properties (#269).

* During construction, validation is now only performed once for each
  element of the class hierarchy (#248).

* Implemented a better filtering strategy for the S4 class hierarchy so
  you can now correctly dispatch on virtual classes (#252).

* New `set_props()` to make a modified copy of an object (#229).

* `R CMD check` now passes on R 3.5 and greater (for tidyverse
  compatibility).

* Dispatching on an evaluated argument no longer causes a crash (#254).

* Improve method dispatch failure message (#231).

* Can use `|` to create unions from S7 classes (#224).

* Can no longer subclass an environment via `class_environment` because we
  need to think the consequences of this behaviour through more fully (#253).

## Rest of 2022

* Add `[.S7_object`, `[<-.S7_object`, `[[.S7_object`, and `[[<-.S7_object`
  methods to avoid "object of type 'S4' is not subsettable" error
  (@jamieRowen, #236).

* Combining S7 classes with `c()` now gives an error (#230)

* Base classes now show as `class_x` instead of `"x"` in method print (#232)

## Mar 2022

* Exported `class_factor`, `class_Date`, `class_POSIXct`, and
  `class_data.frame`.

* New `S7_inherits()` and `check_is_S7()` (#193)

* `new_class()` can create abstract classes (#199).

* `method_call()` is now `S7_dispatch()` (#200).

* Can now register methods for double-dispatch base Ops (currently only
  works if both classes are S7, or the first argument is S7 and the second
  doesn't have a method for the Ops generic) (#128).

* All built-in wrappers around base types use `class_`. You can no longer
  refer to a base type with a string or a constructor function (#170).

* `convert()` allows you to convert an object into another class (#136).

* `super()` replaces `next_method()` (#110).

## Feb 2022

* `class_any` and `class_missing` make it possible to dispatch on absent
  arguments and arguments of any class (#67).

* New `method_explain()` to explain dispatch (#194).

* Minor property improvements: use same syntax for naming short-hand and
  full property specifications; input type automatically validated for
  custom setters. A property with a getter but no setter is read-only (#168).

* When creating an object, unspecified properties are initialized with their
  default value (#67). DISCUSS: to achieve this, the constructor arguments
  default to `class_missing`.

* Add `$.S7_object` and `$<-.S7_object` methods to avoid "object of type 'S4'
  is not subsettable" error (#204).

* Dispatch now disambiguates between S4 and S3/S7, and, optionally, between
  S7 classes in different packages (#48, #163).

* `new_generic()` now requires `dispatch_args` (#180). This means that
  `new_generic()` will typically be called without names. Either
  `new_generic("foo", "x")` for a "standard" generic, or
  `new_generic("foo", "x", function(x, y) call_method())` for
  a non-standard method.

* `new_external_generic()` now requires `dispatch_args` so we can eagerly
  check the signature.

* Revamp website. README now shows brief example and more info in
  `vignette("S7")`. Initial design docs and minutes are now articles so
  they appear on the website.

## Jan 2022

* New `props<-` for setting multiple properties simultaneously and validating
  afterwards (#149).
* Validation now happens recursively, and validates types before validating
  the object (#149)
* Classes (base types, S3, S4, and S7) are handled consistently wherever they
  are used. Strings now only refer to base types. New explicit `new_S3_class()` for
  referring to S3 classes (#134). S4 unions are converted to S7 unions (#150).
* Base numeric, atomic, and vector "types" are now represented as class unions
  (#147).
* Different evaluation mechanism for method dispatch, and greater restrictions
  on dispatch args (#141)
* `x@.data` -> `S7_data()`; probably to be replaced by casting.
* In generic, `signature` -> `dispatch_args`.
* Polished `str()` and `print()` methods
* `new_class()` has properties as 3rd argument (instead of constructor).
