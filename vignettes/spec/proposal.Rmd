## Executive summary
  
Object-oriented programming enables R developers to implement
abstractions, introduce domain-specific data models, and interface
with external systems, among other things. Unlike other modern
programming languages, R lacks a dominant approach to
object-oriented programming. The competition between existing
approaches is unproductive and contributes to social fragmentation of
the community and technical hurdles when integrating across
different systems.

We propose to form a working group that will develop a design
proposal for a system that will combine the most important elements
from the existing approaches while remaining compatible with
them. We will involve key technical experts and community
stakeholders, including R Core and the tidyverse. Upon publishing
the design proposal, we will invite the entire community to
contribute feedback. Finally, we will conclude the working group by
developing and releasing a strategy for implementing, maintaining,
and adopting the framework.

## Background
  
In R, everything is an object. That principle facilitates
interacting with data, because a dataset is modeled as a tangible,
real world object. The user can display the contents of an object,
introspect its structure and manipulate it in various ways.

R provides all of the basic types of objects necessary for
statistical computing. To more effectively reason about a domain,
like genomics, we need to specialize the data types to more richly
model the semantics particular to that domain. Once we have a
specialized set of data structures, we recognize the need for
/abstraction/, which models commonality across data
types. Abstraction is also useful for existing data types, where a
package could provide an alternative implementation, for example,
based on a database or distributed computing system. Abstraction
requires a system of classification, where each object corresponds
to a specific class, and each class derives from another. The
classification system transcends the class instances (the objects),
and it is helpful to explicitly refer to classes when programming.

Fundamentally, a class-based object-oriented system has two
requirements:
* There is a centrally defined class hierarchy, and
* Every object is an instance of a class.

A class is defined by the contract governing its structure and
contents. The contract extends the contract of the parent class in
order to add semantics through additional constraints while
remaining compatible with the parent contract. Code manipulating
objects will often make assumptions about the structure and content
of objects. To mitigate risk, such low-level code benfits from a
validation function, essentially a codification of the class
contract, to verify its assumptions.

While there is intrinsic value in formal modeling of data, for
software to fully take advantage of the richer semantics, it
requires /polymorphism/, where the behavior of the software
with respect to an object depends on the class of the object.

Most object-oriented languages implement message-passing OOP, where
classes define their own behavior by holding functions, called
methods, in addition to fields. When one class calls a method in
another class, it passes a message.

R has a few systems based on message-passing, most notably the R6
package and reference classes in the methods package. These rely on
message-passing in part because their objects are mutable and it is
easier to reason about code when we can typically assume that it is
the receiver being mutated. We exclude from our scope systems with
mutable objects, because immutable objects are generally preferable
for interactive data analysis, relegating mutable systems to niche
applications, such as GUIs and caching mechanims.

As appropriate for a statistical computing language, R has
functional roots, and the most prevalent object-oriented approaches
in R are functional systems, namely S3 and S4, corresponding to the
third and fourth version of the S language, respectively. Objects
tend to be immutable, and top-level functions can be generic, which
means means they dispatch to another function, called a method,
based on the types of the passed arguments. The simplest type of
generic dispatches on a single argument. While single dispatch
supports most applications of polymorphism, there are many cases
where the behavior depends on the interaction of two or more
classes. Typical examples include arithmetic, converting an object
from one class to another and combining two different types of
object.

From these considerations, we conclude that a good object-oriented
system would support:
* An explicit class hierarchy (represented by reified objects) with
* Sytematic instance construction and validation;
* Multiple, at least double, dispatch, and
* Objects with a transparent, introspectable structure.

## Problem statement
  
The two major OOP frameworks in R, S3 and S4, each have their own
limitations, with neither one being sufficiently applicable to gain
dominance. This had led to social fracturing in the community and
technical impediments to compatibility and interoperability. We
summarize those limitations in the table below.

  | S3 limitations                  | S4 limitations                                       | S4 implementation issues |
  |---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------|
  | Classes are only implicit       | Multiple inheritance and dispatch hard to understand | Poor performance         |
  | No systematic object validation | Syntax is unusual (side effects) | Difficult to maintain    |
  | Single dispatch only            | Lack of transparency of object structure and methods |                          |

S3 defines classes implicitly at the instance level, so there is no
explicit class hierarchy.  While the S3 system supports tracking the
class of every object, there is no systematic means of constructing
and validating them to ensure correctness. S3 only supports single
dispatch, so it is difficult to write polymorphic code for
arithmetic, merging objects, converting objects, etc.

S4 has solutions to all of those problems, but it is quite
ambitious, introducing significant complexity, unusual syntax
and loss of transparency. Multiple inheritance, while expressive and
powerful, allows for multiple overlapping taxonomies, which is
difficult to reason about, and the difficulty increases
quadratically when combined with multiple dispatch, where method
selection uses a distance calculation in /n/ dimensions where /n/ is
the number of arguments. The syntax for defining classes and methods
is non-idiomatic and relies on side effects. Finally, the S4
convention (although not a requirement) is to hide slots behind an
API, which improves encapsulation but prevents the basic
introspection capabilities that are desirable when analyzing data
and that R users have come to expect.

Somewhat tangentionally, but still motivating, there are also
technical issues with the methods package, the only implementation
of the S4 system. Its incremental growth over the decades has led to
excessive complexity, as well as performance
issues. In the absence of a new system, we would need to reimplement
S4, so there will be implementation effort regardless.

Documentation limitations afflict both S3 and S4. It is difficult to
describe a programming interface when it consists of generic
functions not coupled to each other or any class. Any package can
define a method on a generic or extend a class, so the documentation
needs to adapt according to which packages are loaded.
  
## Proposal

We believe there may be a better way, but the solutions are not
obvious.  Across popular programming languages, with the notable
exception of Julia, functional OOP is much less common and less well
developed than message-passing, so there are few examples for R to
follow and any advances will likely require research. Therefore, we
propose to bring together a panel of experts to more formally assess
the situation and design a solution. Since we are aiming for this
solution to unify the community, we aim for widespread adoption,
which will require involvement by key community leaders. We will
invite the community to review the proposal and to contribute
feedback and ideas. The working group will integrate the feedback
and finalize the proposal. It will conclude after developing a
strategy for implementation, adoption and long-term maintenance, for
which it will not be directly responsible.

No funding is required nor requested for this effort.
